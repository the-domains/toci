Toci is a health company dedicated to provide personalized nutritional solutions to our clients. Our unique health platform works with physicians to help them plan, follow, and record the best supplement regime for their patients. The platform then utilizes all the data collected to analyze supplement effectiveness and compatibility.  New supplement analysis information is used to create a much more precise Nutrient Recommendation System (NRS). When a client wants to become part of  Toci, she fills out a survey. This survey is then compared to our database. With this information, the NRS creates a supplement regime personalized exclusively for you. We here at Toci then pack the pills into small, labeled bags. You receive 30 bags per package, one per day.
